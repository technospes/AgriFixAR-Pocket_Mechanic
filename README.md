AgriFix AI is a multimodal agricultural repair assistant that helps farmers diagnose and fix machinery using voice, video, and images. The system integrates computer vision, speech recognition, retrieval-augmented generation, and large language models to transform static repair manuals into an interactive troubleshooting system.

The platform enables users to describe machine problems in natural language, record short videos of malfunctioning equipment, and receive AI-generated step-by-step repair guidance based on real technical documentation.

# About the Project

Agricultural equipment failures frequently occur in rural environments where access to skilled technicians is limited. Farmers often rely on large technical manuals or must wait for external support, which results in equipment downtime and financial loss.

AgriFix AI addresses this problem by converting repair manuals into an intelligent assistant capable of diagnosing issues through real-world inputs such as voice recordings, images, and machine videos.

Instead of manually navigating through hundreds of pages of documentation, users can simply describe the issue or capture a short video of the machine. The system then retrieves relevant sections from its knowledge base and generates clear troubleshooting instructions.

# Key Features

## Multimodal Machine Diagnosis

Users can submit:

- video recordings
- voice descriptions
- text explanations

The system processes these inputs to determine the machine category and likely mechanical issue.

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge System

AgriFix AI uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground AI responses in technical manuals.

Manuals are:

- parsed from PDFs
- chunked into semantic sections
- embedded into vectors
- stored in ChromaDB

Relevant sections are retrieved during diagnosis.

---

## Computer Vision Machine Detection

Video frames are analyzed using MobileCLIP to classify machinery types such as:

- tractors
- irrigation pumps
- threshers
- motors
- tillers

This improves the accuracy of the diagnosis pipeline.

---

## Voice-First User Interaction

Speech recordings are automatically transcribed and analyzed, allowing farmers to explain problems naturally.

Example:

```

"My tractor is not starting and making a clicking sound."

```

The system converts this input into structured diagnostic queries.

---

## AI-Generated Repair Instructions

The LLM synthesizes:

- user description
- detected machine type
- relevant manual sections

to produce step-by-step repair instructions.

---

## Visual Repair Verification

Users can upload an image after completing a repair step.

The system verifies whether the repair was performed correctly.

Example output:

```

Repair Step: Tighten the oil filter

Result: Correct installation detected
Confidence: 0.94

```
