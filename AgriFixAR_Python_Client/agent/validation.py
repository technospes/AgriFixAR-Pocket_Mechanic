# agent/validation.py
#
# Centralized repair-plan structural validation.
#
# Called from exactly two places:
#   1. diagnosis_service.py — right after the final step list is settled
#      (dedup + procedure_validator injection both done). This is the
#      plan's point of origin; if it's invalid here, that's where it
#      must be caught.
#   2. repair_agent.py — defense-in-depth, immediately before the agent
#      trusts a plan handed to it by a session. Should never actually
#      fire if (1) is doing its job, but a stale cached plan or a future
#      code path that bypasses diagnosis_service could still reach the
#      agent, so this stays as a second gate.
#
# Anywhere else that needs to check plan integrity should call
# validate_repair_plan_steps(), not reimplement these checks.

    /agent/* endpoints) must catch this separately from normal escalation
    handling and return a generic service-error response (e.g. HTTP 500,
    or a "something went wrong, please try again" message) — never the
